Lamortmon will immediately throw itself upon any Digimon that reacts negatively towards it and smash it repeatedly until it stops breathing. It is a very intuitive Digimon that cannot control its impulses, but there are some Lamortmon who are ashamed of and despise their own nature. The more Lamortmon unleashes its wild nature, the stronger and sharper the vacuum blades of the two giant swords (\"Storm Beast\") worn on its waist become. Calming down a rampaging Lamortmon is impossible unless one has already built up a great deal of trust with them.<br>\n<br>\nLamortmon's special moves include Kasaiso, an attack that slices open the enemy's belly, Koha Batto, in which the full might of its two giant swords are brought down to crush the opposition, and Fuga Rekkanjin, where vacuum blades are unleashed from Lamortmon's giant swords. Finally there is Gouon Kieizan, where all reason is replaced with pure ferocity and both of Lamortmon's giant swords are used to render the enemy in two. This is its most destructive technique, as it both slices the enemy and smashes them into pieces at the same time.",

The combination of this and its fearsome appearance frightens even good Digimon.<br>\n　It is something of a secret that Plutomon's abilities all have the disquieting power to fling villains down to the realm of the dead. In one of those moves, Hell's Gate, a giant mouth appears from the darkness and swallows enemies whole, and their data is broken down into scraps. The Haggard Cluster move has the fangs of its chest release a darkness that will absorb and vaporize any substance in its path. Plutomon's Chaos Light attack is the culmination of its battle rage; once activated, the mouths all over its body bite with an insatiable hunger for data, making it a frightful predator.<br>\n　Plutomon shares the goal of punishing evil with Jupitermon of the Olympos XII. However, there is a longstanding animosity between the two because Jupitermon does not approve of Plutomon's level of cruelty in carrying it out.",

The beauty of its new form gives such an impression of elegance and nobility that some researchers speculate it’s related to the tragic tale of a bard who became a dragon, forced to remain concealed while singing of his mounting sorrows. Fittingly, Plesiomon (X Antibody) only rarely shows itself. It’s also gained the ability to play melodies using its long whiskers, drawing listeners into a fantastical world with Fantasy Mist. There are rumors that Plesiomon (X Antibody) has a different form in this fantasy world, but this remains unverified.",

It also possesses the great strength necessary to wield its giant totem pole, Great Spirit, with ease.

Furthermore, it is clear that its most prominent characteristics are not only its survival instinct, but also its destructive impulse. Truly a Digivolution steeped in aggression.

Its special move Double Scissor Claw ３^３ (3 cubed) is an upgraded version of Double Scissor Claw.",

Even so, its special shape makes it difficult to pick up on radar, earning it the nickname “Stealth of the Deep.” Many abuse Mantaraymon by putting it to work for reconnaissance or underwater bombing raids. This is said to have led to its overfishing, almost to extinction. Digimon who attack Mantaraymon are countered by a ferocious strike of the electroacupuncture Stun Needle on its tail. Its special move Paralyze Tail uses the Stun Needle to stab the bodies of enemy Digimon.<br>\n<br>\n■Effects of the X Antibody on Mantaraymon’s DigiCore:<br>\nAny and all stealth capabilities have been improved to prevent it from being discovered by other Digimon. The level structure of its body makes Mantraymon (X Antibody) harder to detect on enemy radars, and it uses emissions to confuse their sense of smell, as well as its ability to move while barely making any sound. Its body is not invisible, however, so its eyesight has improved to enable it to spot enemies first, and it now makes evasive maneuvers in advance of an approaching foe. These abilities make Mantaraymon (X Antibody) hard to capture even if you know there’s one nearby.

If you’ve abandoned all desire to live, you may catch a glimpse of Megidramon (X Antibody)’s true form. Hell Howling and Megiddo Flame possess an immeasurable amount of evil energy, and are so powerful they’re said to exceed the limits of what a single Digimon should be capable of.",

Despite this process, MetalGarurumon has not lost any agility, and it can destroy its foes using countless weapons hidden all over its body. The four laser sights at the tip of its nose emit invisible beams, and MetalGarurumon makes use of a wide array of sensors, including those for infrared- and X-rays, to analyze its targets. This makes it impossible to escape from MetalGarurumon, even in perfect darkness. What’s more, the mechanical arms extending from MetalGarurumon’s back can emit photoelectric beam wings, allowing it to fly through Net Space at incredible speed. MetalGarurumon’s special move is Freezing Breath, by which it breathes out a blast of air at absolute zero that freezes everything it touches. This move will instantly suspend the vital functions of any living creature it hits. It also uses Garuru Tomahawk to fire a huge missile called the Freeze Bomber from its chest, and Ice Wolf Claw to fire all the weapons on its body at once and wipe out its foes.<br>\n<br>\n■Effects of the X Antibody on MetalGarurumon’s DigiCore:<br>\nMetalGarurumon (X Antibody) has demonstrably better sensors than before, as well as additional weapons. Now that it’s armed from head to toe in weaponry designed to deal with everything from long-range to close-quarters combat, it’s taken to walking on two legs. Its primary weapon, though, is its Gatling gun Metal Storm, which can snipe enemies at long range, fire wide blasts at mid range, and shoot a high-speed stream of bullets at close range, giving MetalGarurumon (X Antibody) overwhelming firepower. A full-on bombardment from it is more than 1.2 times as powerful as one from MagnaGarurumon, essentially making it a beastly artillery unit that’s capable of moving at high speed.",

While Gabumon (X Antibody) itself is still naturally shy and timid, it favors a ferocious fighting style when wearing the pelt, and has become capable of attacking with the agile movements of a Beast Digimon. Similarly, it’s learned to store up a Blue Blaster in its right hand so it can hit foes with a Blue Blaster Hook. For this reason, it no longer wears its precious pelt over its right hand.",

It uses its special move Spiral Masquerade to slash its enemies with the four blades growing from its armor, or Fist of Athena to instantly draw close to the enemy before shooting a shockwave from the Pile Bunker on its right arm.<br>\n<br>\n■Effects of the X-Antibody on LordKnightmon (X Antibody)’s DigiCore:<br>\nBearing the Rose Pile Bunker, a shield of roses that can be used both to attack and defend, as well as Rose's Fencer, a type of rapier, this noble form represents the still-greater heights of power attained by the lord of knights.

Beyond this, both LordKnightmon (X Antibody)’s ribbon blades and its armor have become stronger than ever, and it’s able to integrate the power of its Knightmon servants into the tips of its blades. With its special move Lord of Fraternity, it extends its ribbon blades, fully charged with the power of its Knightmon servants, and slashes through the opposing army with dance-like movements. It also has Noblesse of Rouge, where it traps a foe inside a hurricane of rose petals generated from the core of its Rose Pile Bunker, then penetrates their DigiCore with great precision using Rose's Fencer. Finally, it can combine its sword and its shield to form the Ultimate Thrusting Sword Gran Rozerio, the greatest of Pile Bunker, and blow away everything else on the battlefield with a tremendous shockwave.",

When it is in a bad mood, its behavior quickly turns upset and selfish (that is, “problematic”) in a way that’s out of control. Minervamon uses its special move Strike Roll to unleash a forward rolling slash from its greatsword Olympia, and Madness Merry-go-round to perform a horizontal spinning slash faster than the eye can see.

However, Minervamon (X Antibody) doesn’t seem to mind this, delighting instead that it now has two new friends to play with, which it has named Ulula and Serpens. Also, despite Minervamon (X Antibody)’s reduced size, it shows no signs of having gotten weaker. On the contrary, it’s able to wield the comparatively massive Olympia with a speed that makes this Digimon harder to deal with than ever. Its special moves include Haunted Hair, where it sets Ulula and Serpens on its foes by extending its hair, and Crazy-Go-Round, where it generates a massive tornado of blue flames with a powerful horizontal spinning slash. Finally, it has Sanctus Tormentum, an energy blast it fires from the crystal in its shield. This attack has all the destructive force of the main gun of a massive warship, and is said to be powerful enough to blow away a mountain without issue.",

It’s also trusting of others, and in part to keep itself from growing overconfident, it prefers to coordinate its efforts with the Sistermon siblings and other Digimon nearby rather than acting alone. In this it is unlike most other Royal Knights. Learning by watching the Hinukamuy of its master Gankoomon, Jesmon acquired Atho, René, and Por during its training. This trio performs formidable, autonomous movements according to Jesmon’s instructions: attacking foes directly, backing up Jesmon, or providing aid to other Digimon. Jesmon uses its special move Judgement of the Blade to instantly slice its foe with its arm blades at high speeds, and Weltgeist to perform an omnidirectional counter together with Atho, René, Por, intercepting any enemy attacks with their nine blades. It can use Aus Generics to temporarily overwrite its own data, making it capable of activity exceeding physical limitations.

Finally, it has a nonlethal ace in the hole, where it draws the Ultimate Seibaken out of the DigiCore in its chest and slices through foes.

It appears belligerent at first glance, but Ballistamon’s gentle personality favors peace over conflict, and it never attacks of its own accord. Even so, if a fight breaks out it becomes a champion of unparalleled power, swinging around its strong arms to eradicate foes. Its heavy armor and incredible power offer high potential for both offense and defense. Ballistamon’s forte is unleashing attacks that utilize its power and kill in a single blow if they land. Its massive body is its downfall, however. Slow in mind and body, it does poorly against fast and nimble foes. Heavy Speaker demolishes opponents with low-frequency sounds emitted from the speaker on its chest. This technique hides the power to crush rocks and shake mountains, and only grows as it gets hungry. Furthermore, Ballistamon is proud of the horn on its head—the cornerstone of its close-range attacks—and hates for anyone to touch it carelessly. Its signature move is Horn Breaker, whereby it uses its horn to gallantly throw its opponent. Ballistamon can also lend its armor and power to other Digimon in its Enhanced Armor Mode.",

It can also attack with Diamond Hedgehog, where it makes the most of its tough body and immense weight by curling up into a ball and rolling around. It’s a simple move, but nothing hit by it will ever look the same again. Blastmon also has the ability to take in sunlight and fire a superheated high-pressure laser beam from its mouth with Crystal Breath.

Bagramon can then send that soul to either Heaven or Hell, or transfer it into another Digimon’s body. This is Bagramon’s signature move, Astral Snatcher. Bagramon also has the ability to quickly gather information it wishes to learn thanks to the large ruby it used to replace its missing eye, which has the power to spy on any location in the Digital World through Invisible Snake Eyes. Bagramon is consequently known throughout the Digital World as the Sage of Death. Were Bagramon to repent before God, it would be forgiven, but it has no intention of ever bowing to God again, for it now lives only to banish God from the world, constantly searching for a new world order to replace the cruel old one that God created.",

Its one flaw is that while its ability to analyze the information it’s gathered to formulate a plan is admirable, it sometimes gets so carried away conveying this to its followers that it won’t stop talking. The Denji-maru it holds in its hand is a versatile weapon, excelling at both offense and defense. Defensively, it can absorb an attack and transform its energy into particles, switching to offense by charging up those particles to unleash a blast of energy with Film Buster. What’s more, Hi-VisionMonitamon can also use its Denji-maru as a baton of command, enhancing the attacks of its Monitamon troops to their utmost limit with the particles produced by the Denji-maru. Hi-VisionMonitamon can also take direct control of nearby Monitamon by sending out a signal from the antenna on its head with Photoelectric Execution Formation.

When these two Digimon are together, every day is a priceless treasure. Damemon’s special move Buzzing Fist primarily consists of it spinning its tonfas around. It almost never hits anything, and is better suited to intimidating foes than dealing damage. Similarly, its Gun Vulcan involves disheartening and discouraging foes rather than injuring them. The attack consists of firing small black substances with a foul odor from hidden guns in its feet and tonfas. Since Damemon has to clean up this mysterious substance afterwards or risk angering the Digimon who live in the area, it is always careful about using this special move. Finally, its Boo-st Attack, which involves releasing large volumes of foul-smelling gas while charging forward, is wildly unpredictable, and not even Damemon knows where it will end up.

Although it is naturally inclined to attack anyone who draws near, it’s not actually an aggressive Digimon, and will refrain from attacking so long as it’s not approached. However, since the Chikurimon population explodes at temperatures above 86°F, they can overrun lakes and rocky areas in the summer. This often leads to other Digimon being attacked as they try to get a drink of water. Chikurimon’s ultimate special move is the self-sacrificial Final Chikurimon, which, as its name implies, involves setting off one final blast to destroy itself and its foes alike.",

Even should it be ambushed by a group of enemies, its rock-solid defense and immense firepower together with its ability to easily maneuver through even the roughest terrain allow it to assault and overrun the enemy line. Of particular note is its ability to unleash multiple special moves against several enemies at once. This is what allows DeckerGreymon to fight against entire corps on its own. Also, the energy inside its body has been increased to such an extreme that DeckerGreymon can finish things with one final attack. Even should DeckerGreymon be defeated, that still isn’t the end. The sudden release of all that energy creates an intense shockwave that can scorch the earth for more than six miles around.",

The immense might hidden in the Sword of Storms makes it impossible for anyone to handle. This alone hints at the depths of Tactimon’s true ability.　Even more impressive than its ability as a warrior, it excels at schemes and strategies said to be “ingenuity, bubbling forth like a spring.” Tactimon’s true strength lies in its brains, not its brawn.

While other Digimon may rival DarknessBagramon’s power, it is said to change any Digimon it can use into pawns to boost its power while looking for any signs of opposition, all in order to guarantee the success of its machinations. God of Death Snatcher is one move it uses to control Digimon, snatching the souls from any foe it recognizes, even from a distance. With Eternal Darkmare it flaps its jet-black wings toward enemies with no value to the world, destroying their data instantaneously. The darkness in the hearts of man and Digimon is aggregated and fused into the bottomless well that is DarknessBagramon’s power.

Despite commanding an army, it only believes in its own beauty, and lacks an iota of trust, even for the Digimon in his forces.

According to rumor, some of these Drippin are packed with the “miracle essence” Splashmon fixates on that will turn one’s skin glossy. The Drippin army unleashed with Poisonous Force paralyze the enemy force’s chain of command to sow discord on the battlefield. Splashmon also possesses skills that cause status abnormalities such as Hydro Blaster, which shoots water from its fingertips at high speed and pressure, and Bubble Head, which instantly gathers minuscule elements and turns them into liquid around a foe’s head. When hurt and driven into a corner, Splashmon will open the zippers all over its body to reveal its true form. All who see this form—let alone whoever wounded it—will be swallowed and annihilated by its Tiger Typhoon, which causes an inescapable flood to crash down and drown all foes without fail.

Still, it needs considerable willpower, or it will be blown off by the extreme wind speed. The organ in its body known as a DigiCompressor provides propulsion by condensing inhaled air and firing it backward. This organ can be used for offense as well as flight, condensing air into plasma and shooting it out Jet Sparrow’s muzzles in its ultimate special move, Plasma Blaster. It can also use Air Shooter to blast compressed air with a roar. Air Shooter fires a shotgun blast outward, reducing its effectiveness against long-range foes but letting it obliterate nearby enemies in an instant.",

Because passion is the source of its strength, Shoutmon will not abandon a battle no matter how much damage it receives, contributing to its savage reputation. Although it appears savage, it has a love of music and song, and enjoys humming along to the sounds of nature, such as wind, raindrops, babbling brooks, and rustling leaves. Sometimes it gets too wrapped up in its song and unleashes Soul Crusher even without enemies around, and so putting some distance between you and Shoutmon when it starts singing is a prudent move. For some strange reason it’s always carrying around a McField-brand mic; a Shoutmon without a mic can’t be called a Shoutmon. Losing one’s mic will cause a rapid loss of power from the shock of its loss of identity, before it wastes away completely. Thus, you shouldn’t play pranks on it by hiding its mic.

How can the enemy be wiped out without spilling a single drop of blood? These are the sorts of questions it longs to answer.

It can also stretch out and enlarge its arms to grab an enemy, then crush them with overwhelming force by using High Gravity Pressure. Its legendary Gravity Bang attack involves concentrating as much of the Digital World’s gravity upon itself as possible, then setting off a massive explosion by releasing all that energy at once.

This makes it impossible for enemies to directly perceive OmegaShoutmon. They can only take in its glowing afterimage. OmegaShoutmon’s Flame Cannon transforms the overflowing feelings of friendship in its heart into firepower, releasing a hail of bullets that can not only attack, but also become a wall of iron to protect its allies. It can also channel its zeal for justice into a burst of power from its V-shaped head that shines brighter than the sun, assaulting its foes with Victorize Banking and wiping them out. Or, with Hard Rock Soul, it can concentrate its fervent courage into flames that burst from its fists to either punch enemies at close range or blast them with fire from long range. Alternatively, it can put all of its fierce fighting spirit into its feet, turning them into blades to slice into its foes with Beat Slash. Finally, with Omega the Fusion, it can concentrate the power of the Omega inForce surrounding its body into an aura that it then condenses into a beam to fire at its enemies.

Also, if it concentrates its power, it can unleash a cutting wave of force with Galápagos Field. What’s more, it can use Timoniniser to fire bullets capable of producing different effects through the Gunsword on its head.

Though Ignitemon prefers to avoid battle, it will go on a rampage should anyone interrupt its fun (especially if it’s watching TV).

It may have lost power just like Flamemon, but even so, even many Champion Digimon don’t stand a chance against it.

Once impressed by another’s skill, it will follow orders without complaint, losing itself in its work. Grumblemon isn’t especially smart, and since it takes a high degree of pride in its craftsmanship, it tends to underestimate others.

Opossummon likes dry, sandy soil, and spends most of its time buried in sand with only its balloons sticking up. When it needs to get around, it tightly grips its balloons and performs a series of long leaps into the sky. It is by no means very fast, but it can be frustratingly difficult to capture. Its special move, Mad Balloon Bomb, is a terrifying attack that involves developing a powerful computer virus inside the balloons it holds in its hand, then floating one over its opponent’s head in battle before causing it to burst.",

Fanglongmon has eight eyes and twelve DigiCores outside of its body, which itself is covered in particles of Huanglong Ore, a special mineral boasting incredible hardness that prevents it from suffering any injuries. It uses its special move Taikyoku to continuously dismantle all things in the Digital World into the extremes of light and dark, soon turning them into nothingness.

Only Huanglong Ore can scratch Huanglong Ore. No technique can successfully compare it to other minerals or metals, so the actual limits of its strength cannot be measured. Although it is hard, it is also extremely dense, making it unsuitable for weapons or armor. Huanglong Ore is quite rare, and is only found in the deepest parts of the earth. It is said that it takes many years to unite this ore with a living thing—longer than the age of folklore. As things stand now, Fanglongmon is the only Digimon discovered to have unified with this super-hard ore. Chrome Digizoit eliminates these flaws, making for an outstanding rare metal.",

The Royal Knights are the highest-ranking Digimon when it comes to Network security, and no Digimon has ever been able to crack their stalwart defenses. But since Gallantmon is a Virus type, its role as one of the chief protectors of the Net inherently conflicts with its nature. This means there is always a chance, however small, that it may slip and become a threat instead. Gallantmon is clad in holy armor made of 99.9% pure Chrome Digizoid, and wields the holy lance Gram in its right hand while bearing the holy shield Aegis in its left. Chivalrous by nature, Gallantmon is a faithful servant of its lord. Its special moves include Lightning Joust, by which it strikes a powerful blow with Gram, and Shield of the Just, by which it fires a purifying beam from the Aegis.",

In this it is unlike most other Royal Knights. Learning by watching the Hinukamuy of its master Gankoomon, Jesmon acquired Atho, René, and Por during its training. This trio performs formidable, autonomous movements according to Jesmon’s instructions: attacking foes directly, backing up Jesmon, or providing aid to other Digimon. Jesmon uses its special move Judgement of the Blade to instantly slice its foe with its arm blades at high speeds, and Weltgeist to perform an omnidirectional counter together with Atho, René, Por, intercepting any enemy attacks with their nine blades.

Craniamon is a perfectionist, vying with other Royal Knights Digimon for the highest completion rate of orders from King Drasil. When fighting enemies, its policy is to eliminate them in one-on-one combat; the more formidable the foe, the more reason it has to rejoice. The code of Craniamon’s armor has been manipulated by King Drasil into Black Digizoid. It can access this data, allowing it to produce weapons and shields from its armor. Craniamon uses the special move Claíomh Solais to spin its magic lance at a high speed, unleashing a supersonic Sonic Wave (Waltz's End). Those hit by this Sonic Wave will continue to “dance” until all of their data is demolished. Furthermore, it can use its magic shield Avalon to activate Breath of the Gods, an impregnable omnidirectional defense that nullifies all attacks, albeit only for three seconds.",

Omegamon Alter-S is a different being from the Omegamon affiliated with the Royal Knights, but the multi-purpose performance combining the special abilities of two Digimon remains the same, as does its strength. How the pair came to fuse is a mystery. Did this Omegamon also come to be through someone’s strong will? Or does this fusion exist solely due to some wish? The truth of the matter is unclear. <br>\n<br>\nOmegamon Alter-S uses its special move Transcendent Cannon to shoot plasma from its BlitzGreymon-shaped cannon; furthermore the slashing power of Supreme Sword varies depending on the energy accumulated in the blade. Nothing exists that cannot be cut by a fully charged Supreme Sword.",

It has six giant wings, with the largest pair having a nearly 100-foot wingspan. Referred to in myth as a guardian of the sky, legend has it that Varodurumon is an Ancient species Digimon that has existed ever since the creation of the Digital World. Its feathers constantly give off the holy light known as the Purge Shine, which serves as a barrier that completely nullifies any attack made with evil intentions. Its special attack Aurora Undulation involves amplifying the purifying light of Purge Shine to its absolute brightest, then unleashing it upon foes. This attack is said to be powerful enough to destroy planets, and since it travels at the speed of light when unleashed, it’s practically impossible to dodge.",

It sports a more humanoid physique than the typical large bodies of other Greymon types, but possesses vastly improved power and speed. It may be impossible to defeat with the attacks of Ultimate-level Digimon. The Dramon Killer attached to each of WarGreymon’s arms deal massive damage to members of the Dramon-species Digimon, but also expose WarGreymon to danger, making them double-edged swords. WarGreymon can also combine the exoskeleton parts on its back to form the hardest of shields, Brave Shield. It is said that even among the most battle-hardened of veterans, it is only when one of true valor realizes its own destiny that it Digivolves into a WarGreymon. WarGreymon’s special move is the super dense, high temperature energy beam Terra Force, by which it concentrates all the energy in the atmosphere into a single point before blasting it forward. It also uses Great Tornado to join the Dramon Killer on its arms above its head to perform a spinning, high-speed charge that pierces the enemy.",

Many Digimon worship Venusmon because it is a creature of such beauty and purity. When Venusmon puts on its blindfold, it is able to perceive the world as it truly is with its mind’s eye, seeing through any falsity or deceit. In hiding its eyes, it also suppresses its aura of glamor, meaning that this doubles as an act of consideration, reducing the number of Digimon that would otherwise swoon in its presence. Venusmon has two small but constant companions, the bird Olive and the scallop Hotan, and the three friends keep up an open and lively conversation. Since Venusmon is the Digimon that governs love, its every action in battle soothes its opponents’ hearts. With Healing Therapy it can quell its enemy’s lust for battle just by stroking their head, or it can make foes fall unconscious by blowing them a kiss with LOVE YOU, and making their hearts skip a beat. Finally, if its bird Olive pecks an enemy on the head, they will fall under the spell of Peace Fantasia, which can soothe the heart of even the most savage of beasts.",

However, perhaps because of a need to vent its rage at becoming so similar in appearance to the Digimon it hopes to destroy, AvengeKidmon has turned to rampaging mindlessly, such that it’s now forgotten its original purpose of defeating MagnaKidmon. Its special move Destruction Trigger involves pinning an enemy underfoot, then firing an explosive bullet into them at point blank range from its gun leg, regardless of the fact that this will injure AvengeKidmon as well. It also has Misery Bullet Rain, where it hits its target with a stream of energy blasts from its fingers, then unleashes a barrage of live ammunition at its foe while they’re still in midair.",

It can often be spotted curled up in the sun enjoying a nap, but if it senses something approaching it will quickly dart off into the shadows, where it will wait to see what happens. Sometimes it warms up to those who bring it food, but if an enemy makes such an offering it will remain hidden. If that enemy does not leave, staying in Maycrackmon’s territory, Maycrackmon will fight to defend its space with a ferocity that would be unimaginable to those familiar with its normal, peaceful nature. Its special moves include Modestly Stun, which involves restraining a foe with its two tentacles, then paralyzing them with the stinger on its tail, and Felt Made, where it creates a copy of itself by shooting out lures from its body.",

Sanzomon accumulates the pure energy needed to achieve enlightenment in its DigiCore. Many Digimon are drawn to this DigiCore due to the rumor that any who steal it will achieve eternal life free from injury or disease, and so it is often under observation. Not only enemies are drawn to Sanzomon and its DigiCore, however; so are Digimon dealing with a variety of troubles. Some Digimon idolize Sanzomon, and end up traveling with it to seek answers and the truth of things.",

Since its wing scales have the ability to nullify gravity, it doesn’t even need to flap its wings to stay aloft. As a result, it hardly ever bothers to land, spending most of its life in the air. It is believed to be capable of flying at speeds exceeding Mach 20, meaning very few Digimon could likely survive an aerial battle with Wingdramon. Wingdramon’s special moves include Blaze Sonic Breath, where it breathes out a blast of scorching hot air faster than the speed of sound, and Exploding Sonic Lance, which involves plummeting into a foe at maximum speed to run them through with the lance on its back. Also, since Wingdramon can fly faster than the speed of sound, it creates a shockwave known as Wing Blast every time it moves. This means that even those who can avoid its special moves still take some damage.",

Its special moves include V-Wing Blade, by which it creates an energy field between the horn on its nose and its wingblades before flying at an enemy, and Dragon Impulse, by which it unleashes a shockwave in the shape of a dragon. V-Wing Blade is a powerful technique that AeroVeedramon can use to slice through foes with its wingblades, but its one drawback is that it can only be used in flight.",

This power suit is not just for defense, but also acts as its muscles, dramatically increasing attack power. Aegiochusmon uses its special move Bolt Break Knockdown to perform a punch rush with fists coiled using lightning produced from its horn, or Lightning Pile to drive a pile-shaped bolt down on the enemy from above, driving them into the ground. If this move pierces the enemy once, subsequently-released piles can then connect without fail, no matter where they’re thrown.

Keramon can sometimes Digivolve directly into an Ultimate Digimon without going through this Champion phase, but Digivolving into Kurisarimon allows it to reach a more powerful Ultimate form.

Veemon uses its signature move Boom Boom Punch to spin both arms and strike its opponent. It uses its special move Veemon Headbutt to knock out foes with a powerful headbutt.",

The base is also protected by a powerful Digimon that prevents anyone from getting close, so the purpose of this construction is currently a mystery. FanBeemon uses its special move Gear Stinger to rapid-fire tiny serrated stingers. When the antennae on its head turns red, it contacts its allies with Buzz-Buzz Call.

It’s thought that Omegamon Zwart’s form has temporarily turned black due to some form of exposure to Black Digitron, which is an odd sort of ooze recently discovered that turns Digimon black. While in this form, Omegamon Zwart boasts increased power. Its left arm is in the shape of WarGreymon, with a sword and shield, and its right arm takes the shape of MetalGarurumon, equipped with a cannon and missiles. The cloak on its back deploys automatically when it needs to avoid enemy attacks or to fly. Omegamon Zwart uses its special move Supreme Cannon to fire a blast of absolute zero air from its MetalGarurumon-shaped cannon and freeze the opponent. Its left arm is also equipped with the invincible blade, Transcendent Sword.",
